    <h3><i>What is CSS?</i></h3>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Css is not neccessary</span><span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul class="list1">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">in this
            tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easierfor you to try it yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whwn comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also
        a special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript.
    </p>
    <p>In CSS, selection are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been target, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which style should be applied.</p>
